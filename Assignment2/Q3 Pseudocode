Algorithm matrixDFS(𝐺,𝑣)
	Input: A graph 𝐺,with 𝑛 vertices labeled 0,...,𝑛−1,represented as an adjacency matrix and a starting vertex 𝑣.
	Output: An integer array of size 𝑛, containing the preorder labelling of the vertices.
		P[0] <- v
		for i from 0 to n do
			if G[v][i] is not 0 then
				if i in P then skip
				else append DFS(G,i) to P
		return P
